# This file has all of the ActiveMerchant test account credentials.
# Many gateways do not offer publicly available test accounts. In
# order to make testing the gateways easy you can copy this file to
# your home directory as the file ~/.active_merchant/fixtures.yml
# You can then place your own test account credentials in your local
# copy of the file.
#
# If the login is numeric, ensure that you place quotes around it.
# Leading zeros will be lost when YAML parses the file if you don't.
#
# Paste any required PEM certificates after the pem key.
